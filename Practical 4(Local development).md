Week 5 Practical 4

•	**Learning Activities**

I learnt how to host websites locally by using Xampp, which is a software that allows users to create a localhost web server with PHP, 
Apache and MYSQL services. I also became aware that there are other software for hosting websites locally such as: Ampps, WampServer and MAMP.
This was made possible through watching mainly different YouTube videos explaining the process of installation and how to get them running.

•	**Estimated Hours**

1 hour

•	**Content Insights**

I became aware that for one to host a website locally in Xampp, you had to download the installation files and paste them in the htdocs folder. 
You would then type in “localhost/name of website folder” in the search tabs to begin the installation which on ending would allow you to be 
able to run it on the local server.
Also knew how to access my website databases from: “localhost/phpMyAdmin” where I was able to create, import or export databases.

•	**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

I found that the best way I did learn how to host servers locally was through engaging constantly with what the instructor was doing.
If I did watch an entire video and try it myself, I would get stuck in the middle but if I did the changes together with the instructor, 
it did work and it was much more time efficient.
