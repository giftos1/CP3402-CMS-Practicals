Resources/Links
I used the first 2 weeks lecture and practical materials to re-learn how to create a website using HTML and CSS.
Estimated Hours
I did around 12 and a half hours. I had to do week 1 and week 2 practicals from Web design and development for
relearning and use the knowledge acquired to do this practical.


Content Insights
Doing the first two practicals of (Web Design and Development CP1406) really helped me in knowing how to add links and mostly
using CSS to edit my website through: adding colours, fonts, position the footer, using the hover and visited links features.
I relearned how to add images too and using the alt feature to name the image added.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I tried using the learning resource provided in GitHub that directed to me LinkedIn but after watching a few videos,
I discovered I would be watching lots of videos and having to pause midway in order to put what I had learnt into practice. 
Therefore, I went back to my Web Design and Development first year subject and did the first two practicals which were more detailed and engaging.
