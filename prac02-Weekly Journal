Content Insights
One of the best features I thought Joomla had been the - site modules section- which had a summary of all you had done.
This made it easy to access whichever work you wanted to. 
The save as copy feature as well came in handy especially in smart slider and home section as it allowed one to easily
form an empty document/slider and modify it.
The hardest section that took a long time to know was transferring the website from my local server (XAMPP) to Amazon 
web services cloud. Realised I had to use Ec2 instance which was designed for dynamic websites.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I preferred using YouTube videos which had full tutorials on how to use joomla as I had never used it. 
I did learn as well how to install extensions such as: smart slider which will be handy in the first assignment.
