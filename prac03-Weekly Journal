Content Insights
I had a hard time deploying my locally formed WordPress website in Amazon Web Services. 
I therefore created a new WordPress website in AWS and imported my WordPress file which I had exported from my local server (XAMPP). 
(All in one WP migration plugin made this possible)
Creation of a new database and importing my WordPress database also came in handy when I was trying to deploy my website from my local
server even though I did not do it this in the end.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The one-minute interviews helped me know how to ask better questions when trying to know people. 
I witnessed also how brainstorming is helpful in problem solving in that we were able to come up
with the best solution on how each one of us will interview each other in an orderly manner in one minute.
