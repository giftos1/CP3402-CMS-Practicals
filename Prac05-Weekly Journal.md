## Content Insights
Building child themes can be done in two separate ways, you can either create your css and functions files in a child theme folder using the appropriate naming conventions or you can use a plugin such as child theme configurator which automatically creates the files when creating a child theme. 
I have gained knowledge on how to develop child themes locally and be able to deploy them in a live site. Different code editors can be used to modify your files such as atom and phpstorm where you can modify functions and css files. 
Using inspector is way handy when modifying css files as you can see your live changes and just copy paste them to your css file.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Having built the child themes in two ways: creating folders and files and through using a plugin called child theme Configurator which creates the files, using the 
plugin to create the folders and files was much easier to edit. This is because, one can edit the codes in the wordpress admin site in stead of opening another application like atom or phpstorm. You can quickly update changes and refresh the site to view them. Using coed editors like phpstorm is useful when it comes to
error checking and handling a huge amount of code.
