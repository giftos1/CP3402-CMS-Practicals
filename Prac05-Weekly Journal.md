Building child themes can be done in two separate ways, you can either create your css and functions files in a child theme folder using the appropriate naming conventions or you can use a plugin such as child theme configurator which automatically creates the files when creating a child theme. I have gained knowledge on how to 
develop child themes locally and be able to deploy them in a live site. Different code editors can be used to modify your files such as atom and phpstorm where you can modify functions and css files. Using inspector is way handy when modifying css files as you can see your live changes and just copy paste them to your css file.
