<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

<p>Ever had trouble on how you would find available rental spaces? 
How will you find the Landlord's contact information? Are you looking for an easier way of finding 
rental spaces outside your state?
 </p>
  
<p>Well, look no further as My Properties is your go to solution. </p>

<p>My Properties aims to provide potential tenants with a platform where they can easily look for 
rental spaces across the country from different rental agencies. This is yet to be achieved through 
interlinking our company's AI systems to different rental agencies systems.  </p>

<p>If a tenant lists their house as being available for renting in a certain rental agency,
our AI system will be able to detect the house being listed together with the tenant's contact details and location.
It will also display the rental agency where the property was listed giving credit to the agency and also providing
potential tenants with the option of only looking for houses listed from a certain rental agency. </p>

<p>We will only be in partnership with top rental agencies which have good reputations and have several house listings as we look to
increase more rental agencies as the company expands. </p>
